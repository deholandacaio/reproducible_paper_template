## R 

### General

[R for Data Science Book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) - Book with a practicum of skills for data science in R.

[Advanced R Book](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) - Book designed primarily for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language.

[R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown) - Book for R Markdown references.

[R: Uma Introdução Para Economistas](https://danmrc.github.io/R-para-Economistas/) - introduction to R for economists (portuguese reference) 

### Spatial Data

[Spatial Data Science](https://keen-swartz-3146c4.netlify.app/) - The book aims at data scientists who want to get a grip on using spatial data in their analysis. To exemplify how to do things, it uses R.

[Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) - geographic data analysis, visualization and modeling.

[R as GIS for Economists](https://tmieno2.github.io/R-as-GIS-for-Economists/) - This book aims particularly at spatial data processing for econometric projects, where spatial variables become part of an econometric analysis. 

### R Packages

[Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) - collection of packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. Used for data cleaning, wrangling, visualization, and more. 

[data.table](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) - package for data manipulation. Fast, memory efficient, concise, stable, dependency free. Recommended for large data.

[dtplyr](https://dtplyr.tidyverse.org/) - dtplyr provides a data.table backend for dplyr. The goal of dtplyr is to allow you to write dplyr code that is automatically translated to the equivalent, but usually much faster, data.table code.

[tidyfast](https://tysonbarrett.com/tidyfast/) - provide fast and efficient alternatives to some tidyr (and a few dplyr) functions using data.table under the hood.

[furrr](https://davisvaughan.github.io/furrr/) - combine purrr’s family of mapping functions with future’s parallel processing capabilities

[model summary](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/) - modelsummary creates tables and plots to summarize statistical models and data in R.



## Econometrics

[Introduction to Econometrics with R](https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/index.html) -  Interactive learning material that blends R code with the contents of the well-received textbook Introduction to Econometrics by Stock and Watson (2015).

## Statistics

[Library of Statistical Techniques (LOST)](lost-stats.github.io/) - Publicly-editable website with the goal of making it easy to execute statistical techniques in statistical software.

## GitHub Projects

[Data Science for Economists](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures) - Introduction to the modern data science toolkit (focused on R) graduate course.

## Git

[Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) - Instructions to integrate Git(Hub) with R and RStudio.

[Oh Shit, Git!](https://ohshitgit.com/) - Tips for common git mistakes.
 
[Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) - An open source Git extension for versioning large files.
